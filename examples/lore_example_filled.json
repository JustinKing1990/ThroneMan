    "name": "The Age of Starlight",
    "info": "In the beginning, when the world was young and untouched by the hands of mortals, the stars sang in the heavens and the very earth trembled with ancient power. This was the Age of Starlight, when the old magic still flowed freely through the veins of the world and the barrier between the mortal realm and the realm of spirits was thin as gossamer."
